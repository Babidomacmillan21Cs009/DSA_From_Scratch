🌟 DSA From Scratch – Consistency, Discipline & Growth

By Babido Macmillan

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms from Scratch journey.
This repo is my commitment to showing up regularly, learning from the basics, and building strong problem-solving skills using Java.

🚀 Why I Started

I wanted to:

Remove the fear of DSA and “tough problems”

Build a consistent coding habit

Stop overthinking and start writing code

Prepare myself for future product-based and backend roles

So I decided to:

Learn DSA step by step

Focus on clean logic, not just answers

Track my progress openly on GitHub

This repository is my learning space and proof of effort.

📌 What’s Inside This Repository

Beginner-friendly Java solutions

Problems solved from scratch (no copy–paste)

Simple, readable code with comments

Organized folders (by day/topic)

Notes on time and space complexity

Pattern programs, arrays, strings, linked lists, stack, queue, and more as I grow

If you’re also learning DSA in Java, you can use this as a reference or roadmap.

🎯 My DSA Goals

Build strong fundamentals in core data structures

Improve logical thinking and problem breakdown

Get comfortable with LeetCode / interview-style questions

Become confident in solving problems without immediately looking at solutions

Build a solid base for Java backend + system design in the future

Keep a clean public record of my growth as a developer

🧠 How I Practice

Most problems follow this simple approach:

Read and understand the problem in plain words

Think about the logic step by step (dry run in mind or on paper)

Write clean Java code with meaningful variable names

Add small comments where needed

Analyze time and space complexity

Refactor if I find a better approach later

This helps me focus on thinking, not just typing code.



The structure may evolve as I learn more, but the idea stays the same:
organized, simple, and easy to revisit.

⭐ Final Note

This journey is not about being perfect.
It’s about being consistent, staying honest with the process, and improving one problem at a time.

Thanks for visiting this repo. Let’s grow in DSA, step by step. 🚀
