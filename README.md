## 🌟 DSA From Scratch – Consistency, Discipline & Growth

By Babido Macmillan

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms from Scratch journey.
This repo reflects my commitment to showing up regularly, learning from the basics, and building strong problem-solving skills using Java.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Why I Started

I wanted to:

Remove the fear of DSA and “tough problems”

Build a consistent coding habit

Stop overthinking and start writing code

Prepare myself for future product-based and backend roles

So I decided to:

✔ Learn DSA step by step
✔ Focus on clean logic, not just answers
✔ Track my progress openly on GitHub

This repository is my learning space and proof of effort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 What’s Inside This Repository

Beginner-friendly Java solutions

Clean and readable code with comments

Thought process behind each problem

Organized folders for easy navigation

Time & space complexity notes

You can use this as a simple and practical roadmap if you’re learning DSA too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Goals of This Journey

Build strong DSA foundations

Improve logical thinking

Understand how to break down problems

Become confident with coding challenges

Prepare for technical interviews

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 How I Learn & Practice

Every problem includes:

✔ Understanding the logic first
✔ Step-by-step breakdown
✔ Clean Java code
✔ Complexity analysis
✔ Refactoring when needed

My focus is on learning how to think, not just how to code.
